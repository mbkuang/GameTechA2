3D Battle Pong Demo Manual

Objective: To win the game, you must either make your opponent miss 3
balls or kill them with 5 successful laser hits.

Score: Each time you make your opponent miss the ball, you score a point.
That means your opponent’s paddle didn’t touch the ball. Your score will
be kept in the top left corner of the screen, where it says, “Player 1”.
The same goes for your opponent, except their score is the top right of
the screen, where it says, “CPU”.

Health Points: Each time you (the paddle) get hit with a laser, you lose
a health point. The same goes for your opponent. Like scoring, health
points will also be tracked under Player 1 and Player 2 results.
