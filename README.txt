To build this demo, execute ./build and run the resulting assignment2.exe

To play, use WASD to move the paddle and hit the ball when it approaches
the camera.

The other player, here a simple AI, will attempt to hit the ball back.

The GUI displays the scores of both players, which is currently not updated.
In the final game, hitting the ball will net points, and missing the ball
will lose a life for that player.
