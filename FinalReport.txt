Final Report

Sons of Liberty reporting in! We made a game engine to run a 3D Battle Pong demo. 
Down below are our personal thoughts to what we succeeded and failed in while 
developing this project.

Mitchell’s Thought
Modularity is what makes our game engine very adaptable to our team work and way of forming 
a game. Early on, the three of us, decided to go this route like many others because modular
programming allows for smaller scripts that can be divided up among team members. By having 
these smaller scripts, merging and debugging is easier. We needed this style of programming 
since the three often couldn’t meet up at the same time. As for the game itself, it just makes 
sense to have GUI, Sound, and mechanical scripts separated since each thing is an idea.

Although having a menu is an ambitious goal of ours, I would have loved to see it flourish. 
I think this would have solidified the demo as a true game. So, hopefully on the next project, 
we’ll have this done.

I think time got into our way to do more on this project. I spent several hours on just 
understanding how Bullet Physics and Ogre worked together. Then, spent several more hours 
integrating the two. For many days, our Ogre Object and Bullet Object’s position didn’t sync. 
On the other hand, I spent quite a bit of time on refactoring our code and making sure we 
imported as little as possible.
