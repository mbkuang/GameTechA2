Game
Our game will be a first person shooter where the player will fight through levels with different AI enemies. If the player dies, they reset the level. If the player gets through every level, then they win. The controls will be WASD and aiming with the mouse. The player’s bullets will explode on contact, on clicking the fire button again, or after a certain amount of time.

The new features will be the AI enemies which will attempt to kill the player in different ways. The first will be the birds, which will fly around and either attempt to avoid getting shot or divebomb the player. The second will be frogs which jump from surface to surface and try to snipe the player. The third will be a spawner that can either create one of the two other enemies or shoot bullets at the player.

Architecture Changes
We implemented destructors to clean up memory, and changed the way collisions are detected to make the game run more smoothly.

Extras
We created ‘doors’ that served as goals for the player. These doors lead from one level to the next, and are unlocked by getting the kill count required for each level, displayed in a box in the top right corner of the screen. We also added power-ups throughout the game that could change the player’s weapon, enhance jumping abilities, and increase health/lives, as well as checkpoints throughout the levels.

Division of Labor
The three of us for the most part worked together on most of the components of this project. We met up in the lab often to ensure we could get the most out of pair programming. Sergio’s main focus was implementing the frogs and their A* heuristic, Matthew focused on cleaning up the engine/mechanics and GUI components, and Ethan focused on developing Birds, Spawners, and Power-ups. Matthew and Ethan each designed multiple levels. Overall, we all put in our share to make sure we were able to finish the project on time.
