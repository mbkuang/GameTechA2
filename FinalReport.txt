Final Report

Sons of Liberty reporting in! We made a game engine to run a 3D Battle Pong demo.
Down below are our personal thoughts to what we succeeded and failed in while
developing this project.

Modularity is what makes our game engine very adaptable to our team work and way of forming
a game. Early on, the three of us, decided to go this route like many others because modular
programming allows for smaller scripts that can be divided up among team members. By having
these smaller scripts, merging and debugging is easier. We needed this style of programming
since the three often couldn’t meet up at the same time. As for the game itself, it just makes
sense to have GUI, Sound, and mechanical scripts separated since each thing is an idea.

Although having a menu is an ambitious goal of ours, we would have loved to see it flourish.
We think this would have solidified the demo as a true game. So, hopefully on the next project,
we’ll have this done.

We think time got in our way, stopping us from doing more with this project. We spent several
hours on just understanding how Bullet Physics and Ogre worked together. Then, spent several more hours
integrating the two. For many days, our Ogre Object and Bullet Object’s position didn’t sync.
On the other hand, Mitchell spent quite a bit of time on refactoring our code and making sure we
imported as little as possible.

However, we're happy with how the game turn out overall. Shooting mechanics weren't originally
part of the plan, but we feel it added a cool new dimension to the game. In addition, the game
is very visually appealing. We thought maybe it would be difficult to make it look good with Ogre,
but we figured out how to add custom textures, and in the end, it looks very clean.
